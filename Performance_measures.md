#Performace measures
You'll learn how to assess the performance of both supervised and unsupervised learning
algorithms. Next, you'll learn why and how you should split your data in a trainging set and 
a test set. Finally, the concepts of bias and variance are explained.

###Measuring model performance or error
##Is our model any good?
####Context of task
Accuracy
Computation time
Interpretability
####3 types of tasks
Classification
Regression 
Clustering

###Classification
Accuracy and error
system is right or wrong
Accuracy goes up when error goes down
Accuracy = correctly classified instances / total amount of classified instances

##The confusion Matrix
##Deriving rations from the confusion matrix
##The quality of a regression
##Adding complexity to increase quality
##Let's do some clustering
##What to do with all these performance measures?
##Traing set and test set
##Split the sets
##First you train, then you test
##Using cross validation
##How many folds?
##Bias and Variance
##Overfitting the spam!
##Increasing the bias
##Interpretability
